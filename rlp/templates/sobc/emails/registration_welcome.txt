Hi {{ user.get_full_name }},

Welcome to the community! You are now registered on the SOBC Research Network web site.

The goal of the Science of Behavior Change Research Network is to pool expertise in the research community for this inherently interdisciplinary field.
Our Network is divided into several "projects" and "committees", each organized around a central goal.
Community members are encouraged to post questions to the group, and upload articles or documents that others might find interesting, inspiring, or relevant as they work to meet this goal.

To get started, log on and create your profile. Once youâ€™re on the site, take a look around at what has been posted, and consider sharing your thoughts or uploading articles of your own.

Warm Regards,

The Rapid Science Team
